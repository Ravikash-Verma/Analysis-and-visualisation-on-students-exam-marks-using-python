Description:

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of a dataset containing student exam marks to determine how various factors influence academic performance. The project involved:

Data Cleaning: Preprocessed and cleaned the dataset to ensure data quality and consistency. This included handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and formatting the data for analysis.

Data Analysis: Used Pandas to analyze the dataset, focusing on how different criteria affect student marks. The criteria included:

Parents' education level
Gender of the student
Participation in sports
Means of transport to school
Parents' marital status
Number of siblings
Whether the student is the first child
The analysis aimed to identify trends and correlations between these criteria and student performance.

Data Visualization: Created a variety of visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to represent the relationships and insights derived from the data. Visualizations included:

Scatter plots to explore relationships between variables
Bar charts to compare average marks across different categories
Heatmaps to illustrate correlations
Key Highlights:

Identified key factors that have a significant impact on student exam marks.
Visualized how students' performance varies based on their background and lifestyle.
Provided actionable insights for educators and policymakers to understand the influences on academic achievement.
Tools & Technologies:

Python with libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
Objective:
The goal of this project was to analyze and visualize how various personal and family-related factors affect student exam performance, offering a deeper understanding of academic outcomes.
